# PENTESTING

- My procedure on how I would go about testing specific WAF, Firewalls, HIPS, IPS/IDS or any other security control that would require a pentest in order to

- I will also show how to set up a propper segmented network using pfsense in order to prevent outside intrusion from any vulnerability/disturbing the subnet from legitimate use.
