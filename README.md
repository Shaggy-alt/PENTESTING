# PENTESTING

My procedure on how I would go about testing specific WAF, Firewalls, HIPS, or any other security control that would require a pentest in order to 
validate the security settings in place

I will also show how to set up a propper segmented network in order to prevent any outside intrusion from any vulnerability/disturbing the subnet from legitimate use.
