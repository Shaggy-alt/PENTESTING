# PENTESTING

- My procedure on how I would go about testing specific WAF, Firewalls, HIPS, IPS/IDS or any other security control that would require a pentest in order to 
validate the security settings in place.

- I will also show how to set up a propper segmented network using pfsense in order to prevent outside intrusion from any vulnerability/disturbing the subnet from legitimate use. 

# What you will need

- Using a open source firewall for security.
- At least 2 vuln machines with (One linux, One Windows)
- At least 3 vuln Servers(apache,php,oracle, etc...)
- 1 vuln machine (Android/IoS)
- 1 Kali, parrot OS.
 
# Subnet Mapped out

- 4 Subnets(legacy, sandbox, front end, hardware testing)
- 1 DMZ
- 1 honeypot(for internal testing ONLY)
-
-
